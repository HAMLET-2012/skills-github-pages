Grasshoppers and locusts are the same thing.
Mention grasshoppers, and many people recall pleasant childhood memories of trying to catch them in
meadows or backyards. Say the word locusts, however, and most people think of historic plagues of
pests, raining down on farm fields and eating every plant in sight. Truth be told, grasshoppers and
locusts are one and the same. Yes, we have some species we've dubbed grasshoppers, and others we call
locusts, but essentially we're talking about short-horned members of the order Orthoptera. These
jumping herbivores with shorter antennae are grouped in the suborder Caelifera, while their longerhorned brethren (crickets and katydids) belong to the suborder Ensifera.
